## SUMMARY:
The program runs an 3n+1 function that terminates once it reaches 1. Part A uses a seq3np1 function that keeps track of and returns the count, asks the user for an upper bound for the range value, verifies if the user value is positive (ends program if it isn't) and uses the range inclusively. Part B uses a drawing function that takes the number of iterations (upper bound) as a parameter, correctly graphs the results, updates world coordinates using the setworldcoordinates() based on the largest value returned from seq3np1 and prints the max so far. 

## GRACE DAYS
Grace days used for this assignment: 2

Grace days remaining: 3/5

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
The maximum so far only prints near the marked coordinates instead of on the upper left of the graph.
